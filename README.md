# MoveMatch

MoveMatch is an addon designed for Blender that facilitates the synchronization of video material intended for use with "experimental" move.ai applications. By providing a user-friendly interface to add, order, and sync multiple video clips based on a master clock or specific events, MoveMatch streamlines the video preparation process.
